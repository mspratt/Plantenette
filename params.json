{"name":"Plantenette","tagline":"Simulation of Plant Adaptation to Climate Change","body":"Climate change is going to stress the Phenological Fitness of plants, depending upon their geographical location.\r\n\r\nAn Open Knowledge / Open Science social project to scientifically model plant adaptation, interaction and Phenological Fitness has potential as an educational, professional and decisional tool.\r\n\r\nWe have 3 basic elements to organize, Plant Data, Geological Data and Weather Data.\r\n\r\nDaily Weather consists of daily Maximum, Minimum and Average Temperatures, Solar Radiation, Wind Speed, etc….\r\n\r\nLocation consists of Latitude, Longitude, soil types, slope, etc.\r\n\r\nSpecies entails the values required to model a species’ response to daily weather and it’s location.\r\n\r\nThe Data\r\n\r\n10,000 Geographical locations (lat/long) each with\r\n150 years of daily weather data\r\n(10 elements – wind, solar radiation, precipitation, temperatures maximum, average, minimum, etc)  \r\n\r\nplant development, 10+ models (leaves, bud, flowers, fruits, etc) under drought, frost and other climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to compute and compare several species all competing against each other for water, sunlight and root and canopy space over the long term (100+ year period) using input from people all around the world..\r\n\r\nWe will create an on-line Open Source / Open Communities Internet Platform (ie. Github, Social Network Manager etc.) and develop the tools and social network which impact decision making.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
