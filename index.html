      <p>Climate change is going to stress the Phenological Fitness of plants, depending upon their geographical location.</p>

<p>An Open Knowledge / Open Science social project to scientifically model plant adaptation, interaction and Phenological Fitness has potential as an educational, professional and decisional tool.</p>

<p>We have 3 basic elements to organize, Plant Data, Geological Data and Weather Data.</p>

<p>Daily Weather consists of daily Maximum, Minimum and Average Temperatures, Solar Radiation, Wind Speed, etc….</p>

<p>Location consists of Latitude, Longitude, soil types, slope, etc.</p>

<p>Species entails the values required to model a species’ response to daily weather and it’s location.</p>

<p>The Data</p>

<p>10,000 Geographical locations (lat/long) each with
150 years of daily weather data
(10 elements – wind, solar radiation, precipitation, temperatures maximum, average, minimum, etc)  </p>

<p>plant development, 10+ models (leaves, bud, flowers, fruits, etc) under drought, frost and other climatic conditions.</p>

<p>The goal is to compute and compare several species all competing against each other for water, sunlight and root and canopy space over the long term (100+ year period) using input from people all around the world..</p>

<p>We will create an on-line Open Source / Open Communities Internet Platform (ie. Github, Social Network Manager etc.) and develop the tools and social network which impact decision making.</p>
