Simulation of Plant Adaptation to Climate Change

Climate change is going to stress the Phenological Fitness of plants, depending upon their geographical location.

An Open Knowledge / Open Science social project to scientifically model plant adaptation, interaction and Phenological Fitness has potential as an educational, professional and decisional tool.

We have 3 basic elements to organize, Plant Data, Geological Data and Weather Data.

Daily Weather consists of daily Maximum, Minimum and Average Temperatures, Solar Radiation, Wind Speed, etc….

Location consists of soil types, slope, etc.

Species entails the values required to model a species’ response to daily weather and it’s location.

The Data
