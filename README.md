Simulation of Plant Adaptation to Climate Change

Climate change is going to stress the Phenological Fitness of plants, depending upon their geographical location.

An Open Knowledge / Open Science social project to scientifically model plant adaptation, interaction and Phenological Fitness has potential as an educational, professional and decisional tool.

We have 3 basic elements to organize, Plant Data, Geological Data and Weather Data.

Daily Weather consists of daily Maximum, Minimum and Average Temperatures, Solar Radiation, Wind Speed, etc….

Location consists of soil types, slope, etc.

Species entails the values required to model a species’ response to daily weather and it’s location.

The Data

10,000 Geographical locations (lat/long) each with
150 years of daily weather data
(10 elements – wind, solar radiation, precipitation, temperatures maximum, average, minimum, etc)
plant development, 10+ models (leaves, bud, flowers, fruits, etc) under drought, frost and other climatic conditions.

The goal is to compute and compare several species all competing against each other for water, sunlight and root and canopy space over the long term (100+ year period) using input from people all around the world..

We will create an on-line Open Source / Open Communities Internet Platform (ie. Github, Social Network Manager etc.) and develop the tools and social network which impact decision making.
